    "Language takes on a new meaning when you are learning a second one. Suddenly you become a literalist, paying attention to things like grammar and spelling in way you never would in your native language. You find yourself needing people to speak very, very slowly so you can transliterate what you hearing in real time. Then, slowly, you start to get a more intuitive feel for things. Over time you can go a little faster, filling in the gaps when the grammar and spelling aren't exactly perfect. Eventually, if you stick with it, you can even start to think in the language almost as well as a native speaker. Then, if you are *really* diligent, you start to speak totally unconsciously, sometimes forgetting what language you are speaking. (One way to tell someone is a natively bilingual speaker is when they are in a mixed crowd. If they get their languages crossed, so that they speak exactly the wrong language to each person, then you know the person is natively bilingual. They think in both languages at once.)\n",

    "### **How to write queries correctly the first time, every time**\n",
    "It's pretty easy to tell a novice SQL coder from a seasoned veteran. The novice always starts typing long queries from the top, working through the clauses one at a time until they reach the bottom. Then they run the query and 99% of the time it fails. SQL will give some sort of cryptic error message $-$ nobody knows what they mean half the time $-$ and then the novice spends 45 minutes or so staring at the code trying to spot the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of problems with this approach. Here are a few:\n",
    "- Is there really just one bug? SQL will only report the first fatal error it finds. There may be many more bugs to fix before your code works.\n",
    "- Any time spent staring at the screen is not actually producing working code.\n",
    "- Where do you start to fix the error? Sometimes a bug is spread over several lines; each line is \"correct\" but the combination of lines with each other is fatally wrong.\n",
    "- Sometimes you don't get an error message at all. Instead, the query just runs forever, until it bricks the server (and your professor gives you an F for destroying everybody's homework). Or, the query just returns nothing, a result set with zero rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "A seasoned veteran seemingly never makes these kinds of mistakes. Every query seems to work all the time. Your humble professor has gone entire semesters without having a live SQL bug in a class demo. It can be done! It just takes the discipline to follow the *right* process and the courage to tear apart code that doesn't work. No code is sacred. Sometimes you have to break things before you can fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so what is the process?\n",
    "1. Start with the simplest possible query that does pretty much nothing. Run it to make sure that the SQL runtime is working and that you haven't made a trivial mistake like leaving out the second `E` in `SELECT` or forgotten the semicolon at the end.\n",
    "2. Code the most difficult, most likely to fail, part of the query, making minimal changes to the rest of the query so that it will run. Then run it to make sure you didn't mess up.\n",
    "3. Code the next most difficult ...\n",
    "4. Repeat until the query works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, that really is it! Instead of writing a huge query all at once, write in chucks that can be tested and debugged as you go along. You will write *more total lines of SQL code* but each change will be small and easy to get right before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get more specific:\n",
    "1. **Create a one table  `SELECT * ... LIMIT 10` query.** Which table? How about whichever table is most central to your query. If asking questions about sales transactions then start with whatever table has that.\n",
    "2. **Focus on the `FROM` clause**, joining in any other tables you need. Rerun the query after joining in each table to be sure you haven't borked something. Note: if a table you want doesn't exist, you may need to use a CTE or subquery instead.  \n",
    "3. **Focus on the `WHERE` clause**, crafting the conditions so that the query only returns the relevant rows and no more.\n",
    "4. **Focus on the `GROUP BY` clause (if needed).** This is only needed if you plan to calculate group aggregates (sums, counts, averages, etc.)\n",
    "5. **Focus on the `SELECT` (and `GROUP BY`) clause(s)**, including just the columns you need. If there is a `GROUP BY` clause then be sure to make the table columns consistent with the `SELECT` clause. You can then add whatever aggregates you need (sums, counts, averages, etc.) to the `SELECT`, taking care to give each a meaningful alias.\n",
    "6. **Focus on the `HAVING` and `ORDER BY` columns.** Note that you can put conditions on columns that don't appear in your `SELECT` clause.\n",
    "7. **Remove the `LIMIT` clause (unless it is relevant to your query).**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fun fact: SQL actually runs your clauses in *almost* same order as above.**\n",
    "> 1. `WITH` clause to make sure the CTE data is available\n",
    "> 2. `FROM` clause to check the JOINS and subqueries work\n",

    "> 4. `GROUP BY` clause to establish the context for all aggregates\n",
    "> 5. `HAVING` clause to restrict the groups in the resultset\n",
