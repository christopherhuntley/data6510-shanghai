    "## **NoSQL Databases**\n",
    "The term \"NoSQL\" was first coined in the late 1990s and gained popularity among application programmers about a decade later. It refers to databases that do not rely on the relational model. That does not mean that SQL (or some close approximation) isn't used, but rather, that NoSQL systems extend beyond the traditional relational model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason some interpret NoSQL as \"Not only SQL\" rather than exclusively no use of SQL at all. In fact, each of the NoSQL technologies surveyed here *could* in fact be implemented in SQL, and we will try to use relational models to explain how each relates to SQL and how it extends beyond it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we even need to go beyond SQL? \n",
    "- **Developer Experience (DX):** As we have discussed before, there is a natural impedance mismatch between a declarative language like SQL and a more imperative application development language like Python, Java, or JavaScript. NoSQL technologies remove much of the discomfort some programmers feel when using SQL.\n",
    "- **Performance:** Selectively relaxing the rules of the relational model can sometimes bring speed and cost benefits that outweigh the integrity protections of the relational model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the models below we will discuss how it differs from the standard relational model, potential DX or performance benefits, and the most common usage scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key-Value Stores**\n",
    "Key-Value (KV) stores are most useful when a table is very sparse, like this section of the NBA PlayLog data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Sparse Table](./img/L11_Sparse_Table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If most values in a table are blank, then why waste time and effort recording them in rows and columns. Instead, just store the data you actually have, tagged to suit however you may need to retrieve it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In relational terms, a KV store is just a single two column table   \n",
    "`kv_store(`**`key`**`, value)`\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- **`key`** is a unique index\n",
    "- `value` is a datum to be stored\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the data type of the `value` is either encoded in the data itself (e.g., like i2'15' or s5'Steve'), encoded in the key, or assumed to be text. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Heads Up:** We have already seen an example in Lesson 5. The Entity-Attribute-Value model can, with the right modeling conventions, be seen as a kind of KV store. The key would be a composite of the entity and attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering how we can replace a two-dimensional table with rows and columns with a one dimensional KV store. We do it exactly like we would with composite indexes in the relational model, with the row and column encoded in the key. It's all in the patterns we use when constructing the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following could be used to record the `assist`,`away`, etc. columns as key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Key** | **Value**|\n",
    "| --- | ---|\n",
    "| 2:away | Derrick Favors |\n",
    "| 2:home | Marc Gasol |\n",
    "| 18:opponent | Kyle Lowry |\n",
    "| 20:num | 1 |\n",
    "| 21:num | 2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "KV Stores are commonly used for creating data caches for the web. Here, for example, is the data that Jupyter is keeping about *this page* (somewhat redacted) while I have it open in my web browser : \n",
    "![](./img/L11_Colab_Local_Storage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar caching technology is used by web servers to minimize reads from the disk storage. If the same CSS is used on every page then why read it from disk every time? The server doesn't. Instead it serves the CSS from a highly-optimized, in-memory KV cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Wide-Column KV Stores**\n",
    "Wide-Column data stores extend the KV model to allow data storage as multiple columns:\n",
    "- The keys are just like any other KV store.\n",
    "- The columns are encoded like a SQL `STRUCT` (or JSON object), with each column having a name and a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The columns for each key may vary, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Key** | **Value**|\n",

    "| 18 | {opponent:Kyle Lowry} |\n",
    "| 20 | {num:1} |\n",
    "| 21 | {num:2} |\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect is to condense the already very space-efficient key-value model by eliminating overlapping keys. In this case we eliminated a row of data storage by sharing the key `2` for the `away` and the `home` columns. \n",
    "\n",

    "### **Document Stores**\n",
    "Document stores build on the KV model to construct arbitrarily complex (and data rich) databases of *semi-structured* data. Semi-structured data has a schema (so we can interpret and process it), just like any other data model, but not one we can know about in advance. Specifically, in a document store each document (roughly equivalent to a table row) can have its own schema, structuring the data however it likes. We can then only know a document schema *after* opening the document, whereas for the relational model all table schemas are known *before* doing any DML operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example of a document storage format is that used by Microsoft Word, which acts as a *container* for components (blocks of text, titles, images, tables, etc.). One can insert just about anything inside an MS Word file (even malware, unfortunately). MS Word will then compose and render the components as documents in real time so end users can read and edit the data contained inside. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more relevant example is JSON, which has become the de facto standard format for transmitting data over the web. Like with an MS Word document, a JSON object or list acts as a container, into which we can insert ... JSON objects and lists. The result is a tree structure, with objects and lists nested inside each other to some unspecified depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, for example, is what a Jupyter notebook (this one, in fact) looks like when you open it in a text editor:\n",
    "![Jupyter as JSON](./img/L11_Colab_As_JSON.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the `ipynb` file format is really just highly structured JSON. Here's the same JSON in a nicer, pretty printed format:\n",
    "![Prettified JSON](./img/L11_Pretty_JSON.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is mostly a list of \"cells\" $-$ look for it in the screenshot $-$ where each cell has a `cell_type`, `metadata`, and `source`. The `source` is whatever we typed into the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to JSON in the **Pro Tips** section later in this lesson. \n",

    "A graph database organizes data into three kinds of structures:\n",
    "- A set of **nodes** that represent entities within the domain\n",
    "- A set of **edges** (or arcs) that connect nodes to represent relationships\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On a superficial level, graph databases are a lot like relational databases, with nodes = entities, properties = attributes, and edges = relationships.  A graph database, however, is much more flexible in how it defines these things: \n",
    "- Since we are not using relations, there is no need to separate the entities by type. If we like, **we can treat each node as a unique type, with its own distinct properties (kept as Key-Value pairs).** \n",
    "- Whereas a relational database treats relationships as being between entity types, graph databases define them on specific node pairs. **Any pair of nodes can be connected by an edge, regardless of type.** \n",
    "- While each node has a unique identifier, there is no concept of type-based foreign keys. Instead, **each edge is treated like an entity with a unique identifier.** The edge then has two implicit properties to reference the nodes it connects. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, a graph database *can* be mapped into a very specific relational model where:\n",
    "- There are three types of entities: nodes, edges, and properties.\n",
    "- Edge entities are directional, with each having a start node and an end node.\n",
    "- Properties are associated with nodes or edges as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the graph database is really just a special case of the relational model, then what's the point? For some applications a graph database can be much, much faster than a relational database. For example, consider the database behind the [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) game, where each working actor has a *Bacon Number*, BN, that represents the number of edges needed to connect them to Kevin Bacon. Kevin Bacon's BN is 0. Anyone who has appeared in a movie with him has a BN of 1. Anyone who has appeared with anyone whose BN=1 has a BN of 2, etc. The game is to guess an obscure actor's BN, with super bonus points for finding a movie actor *anywhere in the world* without a BN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let all the movie credits in the world be stored in a single table called `credits`, with one row per actor and movie title. To keep things as simple as possible we will assume that \n",
    "- Each actor and each movie title has a unique identifier (`actor_id` and `movie_id`).\n",
    "- We already know the `actor_id` identifiers for Kevin Bacon (`kevin_bacon_id`) and the other actor in question (`other_actor_id`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to find all people with BN=1 we would join the credits table with itself one time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Check for BN=1\n",
    "SELECT distinct c1.actor_id \n",
    "FROM credits AS c0 \n",
    "    JOIN credits AS c1 USING (movie_id)\n",
    "WHERE c0.actor_id = kevin_bacon_id AND c1.actor_id = other_actor_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "(If we want to look for a particular actor, we can just include them as `c1.actor_id` in the `WHERE` clause. If there are no results then the actor's BN is greater than 1.) \n",
    "\n",
    "To find all the movies that BN=1 actors appeared in would we add in another join:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT distinct c2.movie_id \n",
    "FROM credits AS c0 \n",
    "    JOIN credits AS c1 ON (c0.movie_id = c1.movie_id)\n",
    "    JOIN credits AS c2 ON (c1.actor_id = c2.actor_id)\n",
    "WHERE c0.actor_id = kevin_bacon_id\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then repeat the process with another join to get the BN=2 actors. To get the BN=3 actors we would add on two more joins to the chain. If we repeat the process out to BN=6 (the theoretical maximum for a working movie actor) then we would have 11 joins in the chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT distinct c11.actor_id \n",
    "FROM credits AS c0 \n",
    "    JOIN credits AS c1 ON (c0.movie_id = c1.movie_id) # BN=1\n",

    "\n",
    "Running up to six queries like this seems ugly but still plenty doable, until you realize that the `credits` table might have 50 million rows. **Even with supercomputer hardware the query could take virtually forever.** With a graph database and a well-tuned search algorithm, however, we can find the specific sequence of edges connecting any actor to any other in less than a second. We can make it *even faster* if we assume that one of the actors is Kevin Bacon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The secret is in the specificity of the graph database model. We don't need to explore all possible actor-to-movie-to-actor connections. Instead we only need to follow the connections along the shortest path, which can be found fairly quickly via dynamic programming. If we want it even faster we can try A* search with an \"explore big cast movies first\" strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The achilles heel of the graph database model is bulk computation. If we need to do the same repetitive operation millions of times, perhaps concurrently, then a relational or perhaps a document database is likely a better fit, depending on the operation in question.

    "\n",
    "In lesson 5 we learned that entities should be atomic, indivisible through normalization. Among other things this means that attributes should be singular, represeting just one fact about a given entity. Plural attributes, meanwhile, should be normalized out into one-to-many relationships to new entity types. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we just didn't bother to do that? \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` collection types were added to the SQL standards in a wave of enthusiasm for object-relational features in SQL:1999 but then (like window functions) largely ignored by most database vendors until 2018. Why ignore the standard? Because collection types permit us to skirt around a fundamental law of normalization: thou shalt not use repeated fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "An `ARRAY` is equivalent to a Python list. The iteral syntax is even the same: for the NBA example a lineup could be represented by \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "['Kyle Lowry','Fred VanVleet','OG Anunoby','Pascal Siakam','Marc Gasol']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A `STRUCT` is then the equivalent to a Python dictionary. Once again, here is the NBA example with positions as keys:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "{'p1': 'Kyle Lowry', 'p2': 'Fred VanVleet', 'p3': 'OG Anunoby', 'p4': 'Pascal Siakam', 'p5': 'Marc Gasol'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can nest collections inside of one another to create complex data structures. In fact, many database vendors include utilities to translate directly to JSON. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, it is not a good idea to use these sorts of collection types in a transactional database, where vigilance is needed to keep the data consistent and anomaly free. However, for dimensional data warehouses, where the **dimension tables** are often denormalized anyway, they make **perfect sense**: no extra joins, no redundant columns, etc., just the relevant context in a concise format. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Technically*, collection types do not actually violate normalization rules.** A collection is a **container** that can hold structured data. The container itself is singular, though the contents might be plural. It's like how you might keep a plastic *container* of cut celery sticks instead of storing them in a pile on the shelf. The container is *one* thing (with the sticks nested inside), but you have to open the container (unpack it) to get your snack. That's exactly how SQL `ARRAY` and `STRUCT` work. We have to use functions and special syntax to pack and unpack data. Otherwise, SQL just treats it like an image or other binary data. Of course, it *is* still a problem that we don't know what's inside the container before we unpack it but we can still say the table itself is 1NF. "
