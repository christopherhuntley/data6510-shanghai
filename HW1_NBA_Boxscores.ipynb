    "The `PlayLog` table is designed to make it as simple and efficient as possible to *record* gameplay as a seuqence of events. Each row records a *play* event logged in near-real time in the course of the game. The specifics of each event (who, what, when, where, and how) are captured in numerous columns, each with a very specific meaning: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `PlayLogID` (autogenerated by the database) and `play_id` (found in the raw source data) are unique to each play and can be treated as candidate keys or *indexes*. (We'll learn more about keys and indexes in Lesson 4.)\n",
    "- `a1` - `a5` and `h1` -`h5` list which 5 players were on the court for the *away* team and the *home* team.  Each player name is unique for a given season, by the way. If there are two players with the same name -- yes, this has happened! -- then NBA stats department assigns each of the players a unique name. We'll treat the names like unique indexes for the players. \n",
    "- `event_type` indicates what kinds of statistics can be drawn from the play. A \"shot\" for example is a made shot, a \"miss\" is a missed shot, etc. \n",
    "- `player` records which player was the *subject* (initiator) of the event. If the `event_type`=\"rebound\" then the `player` is the one credited with the rebound.  \n",
    "- `opponent` is used in the event of a foul to indicate *who* on the opposing team was fouled.  \n",
    "- `possession`, `steal`, `block` work like `opponent` in that they indicate another player involved in the play. If the play is a turnover , then the player that caused the turnover would appear in one of these columns. \n",
    "- `period` (quarter), `remaining_time` (in the period), `elapsed_time` (in the period) record the approximate time of the event wihin the game. For example, `period`=1 and `remaining_time`= \"9:58\" mean the event occured in the first quarter with 9 minutes and 58 seconds on the game clock. \n",
    "- `shot_result`, `shot_distance`,\t`original_x`, `original_y`,\t`converted_x`, and\t`converted_y` are used to \"map\" the location of made and missed shots throughout a game. \n",

For example, if a player scores a basket with an assist (pass) from another player, then that is two facts that have to be recorded. \n",

Thus it includes contextual facts that are not in the original game log data. **The complete dataset for the 2019-20 season is over a million rows.** (However, to keep things simple, we will only include the play facts for the NOP vs TOR game.)\n",
