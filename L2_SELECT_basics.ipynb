    "SQL is just not like the other popular programming languages. Consider, for example, the January 2021 *Tiobe Index*, where SQL is listed as #12. Every other language on the list can be used to build apps and systems. We call them general purpose languages. SQL, however, is explicitly a special purpose language, designed for data management and only data management. The most similar in that respect is R, with its focus on data analytics. Everything else is strictly general purpose.  So, if SQL is so out of step with the rest of the programming language universe, why is it considered a critical data analytics skill? Because it does its job extremely well, of course, but there is more to it than that.\n",

The others came along *decades* later. By then, C and SQL were already ubiquitous, in use by millions of programmers around the world."

    "**Age and \"first mover advantage\" are not all of the SQL story though.** Recall the three tiered model from Lesson 1? Each of the tiers is a *black box*, with internal implementation details hidden behind a *public interface* (often called an API). As long as a given tier can handle certain requests, phrased in such and such a way and producing results in specified format, then nobody has to care *how* it works. That is extremely powerful! SQL just happens to provide just such an interface. For basic CRUD operations in the data tier, SQL provides a complete and standard set of requests and responses that any application or system can rely on. Further, if a better implementation of the standards embodied by SQL comes along, we can upgrade to the newer technology without modifying *any* existing code."

    "  So, **when asked \"Why SQL?\" the best answer is \"Why not SQL?\"** because that is the right way to think of it. SQL works so well for many, many applications supported by millions of programmers. Thus, the burden of proof is to show that SQL can't get the job done and then propose something that does. Even then, the smart boss will instinctively ask for the same data integrity protections provided by SQL. In the end, using anything else is like swimming upstream, where relatively gentle currents on a clear day can become deadly in a storm. In other words, never assume that what works for local storage on an isolated iPhone will work for the cloud servers it connects with. The volume of data and the likelihood of corruption is just too high. Some companies, usually startups, that made the \"No, not SQL\" choice are having to live with their decisions and ... scaling up to SQL compliance. Why not start there from the beginning?\n",

    "Structured Query Language (SQL) was developed by researchers at IBM in the early 1970s. The original name was Sequel, which is how many of us pronounce SQL to this very day. Unlike human language, programming languages have version numbers that track evolution over time. For many years, SQL was whatever IBM defined it to be, but by the mid-1980s SQL was an established standard (SQL-86) endorsed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). There have been newer versions over the many years since (most recently as SQL:2019) that extend the original SQL-86 standard to include things like XML data, binary large objects (BLOBs), and window functions. We will come back to these newer features in the latter portions of this course."

By 1996 it was the most deployed DBMS on the web. There were two primary reasons for this popularity:\n",
