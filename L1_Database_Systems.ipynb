    "When viewed with an IT director's eye, technical resources include anything that has to be installed. Consider, for example, the technology needs of a small regional retail chain, as diagrammed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each **retail location** (on the left), one would find a number of devices needed to complete sales, track inventory, and report to headquarters. While some of the technology might be proprietary, much of it would be licensed from vendors who specialize in retail systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the right is the **corporate headquarters**, where functional managers and executive staff make decisions about marketing, human resources, supply chains, technology, etc. The needs of these executive offices are somewhat less industrial than the retail locations, with more of a need for historical data that can be analyzed offline. While they may, in fact, need to monitor individual transactions (e.g., if fraud is detected) they usually work with aggregated data (data marts) constructed to support specific kinds of decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere in between the stores and headquarters is a **centralized data center**. Invisible to the users, this is where all the work is done to process and record the transactions (sales, incoming orders, outgoing shipments, etc.) that are the beating heart of the enterprise. It cannot be exaggerated how critical these central servers are: if they go down or are hacked then *everything* else reverts back to pencil and paper.\n",

    "Some are so small that you barely know they are there, **embedded** in other hardware and software. So, for example, the scanning wand used by a point of sale system may keep a cache of recent scans. Or your sports watch keeps a record of your heart rate that is synced (uploaded and reset) through an app on your phone. Often, if the device is turned off (all the way off, not in hibernation) for a long enough period of time, the data is lost. However, with static memory and solid state disks becoming cheaper and smaller every day, even the smallest devices often come equipped with persistent storage that survives a reboot.\n",

    "The next level up is data stored in files by an **end user app**. Such data will usually survive a system restart, though perhaps with some corruption if the system was writing data to storage at the time. In our example, the point of sale system may have a local storage mechanism so it can recover from power outages, void incorrect transactions, etc. Similarly, behind the scenes most desktop software stores data in caches, documents, or other kinds of files in order to improve the overall user experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At a broader level are so-called **workgroup applications**, where data access is shared with a limited number of other users and devices on the same local area network (LAN). In our retail example, the back office systems and inventory systems might share a workgroup server that keeps track of recent activity. At the other end of the diagram, a similar setup connects the executive information systems and the analyst workstations to the data marts and file archives needed to do their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the largest scale are the **enterprise** systems in the center of the diagram. They are not necessarily designed for raw speed but instead for throughput.

    "\n",

Here the emphasis is on aggregating and understanding the transactions data and perhaps integrating it with other data collected elsewhere. These sorts of activities are more about data integration and communication, with read-only access to (scrubbed and aggregated) historical data in a data warehouse or data mart. Such systems may be nearly as large as the transaction systems, in that they contain the same basic volume of facts, but they do not have to support as many users and are less subject to data corruption.

    "### **Security: Files / DBMS / Services**\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude our discussion of information technology with a note about the effect of architecture on privacy and security. As an illustration please consider the three \"houses\" below, each of which are designed with security and privacy in mind. The first is Philip Johnson's world famous Glass House, which looks stunning but would not provide much in the way of privacy. In the center is Johnson's almost as famous brick Guest House, a windowless structure with a single door that would provide lots of privacy and security, except for the easily accessed skylights on the roof. Lastly, we have the bomb shelter on the right, which provides maximum security and privacy but only if one is willing to trade off natural light and air.   \n",
    "\n",
    "![Glass Brick Concrete](./img/L1_glass_brick_concrete.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Glass House is analogous to files on a local hard drive or in an email attachment.** Just as the thick panes of glass give the appearance of security but not any privacy, so does relying on file storage to keep your data safe. The contents of your files are visible to anyone with physical access to the storage device or network. While we can, of course, provide security ourselves $-$ with curtains for the house or encryption for the files $-$ doing so would potentially spoil the elegance and convenience of the original design. *So, unless you want to spend your time worrying about private data leaking out of your organization on thumb drives, email, etc. then do not rely on file storage to secure your files. It's about as insecure as it gets.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The brick Guest House is like direct access to a Database Management System (DBMS) over a secured local network.** By providing a single point of access (i.e., a thick wooden door), such systems make it fairly simple to secure the data behind a user authentication and authorization system. *However, just as the brick house's skylights can potentially be compromised, so can a database located on a local network drive. Its files may take longer to break into but with time can be compromised by those with the patience and skill to do so.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, the bomb shelter is equivalent to an encrypted database that can only be accessed through a secure application server.** In this case, *all access* is limited to the specific commands (service requests) implemented by the app server. While in principle we could argue that a DBMS is itself an application server, in this case we have the ability to layer on more security beyond what is provided by the database vendor. It is certainly inconvenient, but is about as secure as it can possibly be.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, whether you are storing data in the cloud or or your local hard disk, be sure that you use a secured network, with a single point of access to the data. Even then, use encrypted file storage to provide one more layer of protection from those with physical access to the server. What you may lose in raw speed will be more than made up for with peace of mind.**"

Continuing with our web example, each web page is assembled by the web browser through one or more requests made of the web server. Each request is received, authorized, and (potentially) executed, with a **response** (HTML, CSS, javascript, file, etc.) delivered back to the browser for presentation to the user.  \n",
    "- The **data** tier that is responsible for reading and writing persistent data.

    "Maintaining data integrity is an active process that requires continual evolution of the database itself. That, in a nutshell, is the focus of database design.\n",

    "#### **Conceptual Models**\n",
    "The primary conceptual model used by database designers is the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). Interestingly, ERDs are not actually about data so much as the things (entities) the data is meant to describe. An **entity** is a *specific* thing we capture data about. Typically, the entity has a name or number that acts as an **unique identifier**; if any two things share the same identifier then neither is an entity. The facts that we attach to an entity are called **attributes**. Some attributes are special, used to refer to other entities, usually of a different type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the DeluxCare ERD below there are three types of entities (Customers, Invoices, and Garments), each shown as a rounded box. The name of the entity type is shown as a label at the top of the box. The attributes are then listed in the bottom portion of the box. If an attribute is to be used as an identifier then it has a `PK` (for *primary key*) listed to its left. Attributes that are used as cross-references are list with an `FK` (for *foreign key*) next to them. The nature of the relationships between the entities are specified with special notations at either end of the connecting lines. So, for example, the line connecting `Customer` to `Invoice`  specifies that each customer has zero or more invoices and that each invoice must relate to exactly one customer. (In fact, the `customer_id` foreign key on the Invoice entity is there because of the relationship. However, there is no corresponding `invoice_id` foreign key on the Customer entity. Why do you suppose that is?)\n",

    "- Each table corresponds to a given entity type\n",
    "- Each row of the table corresponds to one *instance* of the entity type\n",
    "- Each column contains one attribute (fact) for the instance\n",
    "- Row and column order do not affect data meaning\n",
    "- Each row has one (or more) column(s) called a *primary key* that can be used to retrieve the row after it is created\n",

    "The physical model of a given database is somewhat vendor-specific. Each DBMS vendor provides different options, depending on the needs of their customers. Here we will focus on just two of the many of the possible physical design decisions behind a given DBMS. Both relate to how data redundancy is used to make the database more reliable and performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first decision is how the data is stored and backed up. One option is to keep the data in files on a local hard drive. MySQL, for example, stores each table as a single file buried somewhere on a hard disk. SQLite does something similar, except in a location of the user's choosing. In either case, one can back up the data by copying the actual database files, along with perhaps some metadata about the files themselves. The alternative to locally-accessible files is to hide all storage implementation behind a service, which may be the database management system itself. In this case, backups are often retrieved as SQL 'dump files' that contain instructions for recreating the data from scratch. Of course, since the server is managed by the vendor, they may also offer a paid backup service that uses proprietary technology of their own design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second decision is how many live copies of the data to keep. The classic approach is to use a centralized database server. In this case there is only one live copy of the data to secure, backup, etc. However, this can cause delays for remote users, where each DB request and response may have to travel a long route through the Internet, causing significant latency for the end users. The solution is to use a decentralized architecture, with multiple copies of the database distributed close to the end users. It is then the database system's job to keep the various copies in sync so that two users on opposite sides of the world aren't working with different \"facts\" for the same entities.   \n",
