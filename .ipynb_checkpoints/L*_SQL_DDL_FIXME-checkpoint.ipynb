        "In the early stages of systems design we go to great pains to separate design models from technical implementation details. We see this in database design most starkly. While the relational model defines domains and codomains, it does not address data types. ER diagrams can model concepts that can't actually be implemented in relational databases without a translation step. Even the rigorous laws of the normalization process come with plenty of exceptions to allow for special cases. We can define even more normal forms but at some point it just makes sense to get on with implementation. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now it is finally time to put all those details back in. There is a lot more to SQL than just `SELECT` queries!\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL is both a language and a platform. The language is a place for logical design. We create tables and define all the necessary rules to keep our data clean and informative. We then use yet more SQL to populate and maintain the tables. That's all built into the SQL language and is for the most part derived from the Relational Data Model. \n",
        "\n",
        "The SQL platform is 100% about implementation. Where does the data reside? How is it backed up? Who has access to the data and what are they allowed to do once they get there? These things are also supported in the SQL language, *even though they are technically not part of the Relational Database Model*. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this lesson we will cover SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements needed to implement a database design. But first, we will review some of the logical design details we didn't cover in module 3. \n",

        "> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. -- Phil Karlton\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to minimize typo bugs and reduce the mental burden for SQL users, it is important to always follow a consistent naming convention. It should be possible to *just know* if a query has a typo bug or a given column is likely to be spelled a certain way without having to read documentation. That's where conventions come into play. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the old days when most SQL coders were coming from COBOL or Fortran backgrounds, most developers followed naming conventions like:\n",
        "- Table names in `ALL_CAPS`\n",
        "- Column names in `Initial_Caps`\n",
        "- Short but descriptive names for everything, like variables in another language\n",
        "- All table and columns names in the singular form\n",
        "\n",
        "However, as the old languages died out, SQL coders began to ignore the old naming conventions in favor of a style more like what they were used to:\n",
        "- Table names with `Initial_Caps` (or `no_caps_at_all`)\n",
        "- Column names in `lower_case_letters`\n",
        "- Longer table names, especially in big databases with *thousands* of tables\n",
        "- Collective (plural) table names and scalar (singular) column names\n",
        "\n",
        "Names are important but not all of the story here. Coding *style* matters too. By being consistent and intentional, we can actually eliminate bugs! Some examples:\n",
        "- Use uppercase for SQL keywords like `SELECT` or `AS`. This makes it clear what parts of a statement are syntax versus names of things. That way the next coder will know where to look for typos. \n",
        "- Avoid long lines of text. Instead, break statements into logical chunks (e.g., clauses in a `SELECT` query), one line at a time. Use indentation to indicate that a statement continues onto the next line. \n",
        "- When choosing data types, always prefer the standard ones over vendor-specific ones *unless* there is a major performance benefit and you don't mind being locked into a specific vendor's products forever.\n",
        "\n",
        "For what it's worth, there are [style guides](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/) that dictate many of these rules so we don't have to decide. Pick a set of rules and then be consistent. SQL itself doesn't care, but every other SQL coder who works with you certainly will. \n",

For example, cross tables derived from associative entities (see *Converting ERDs to Relations* in Lesson 6) will often use a composite primary key composed of the table's *foreign keys*. That's a matter of preference, however. \n",

        "### **Dump Files**\n",
        "Databases systems are not like other software you may have encountered before. They are **always** reading and writing from/to storage. Thus, making a backup is not simply a matter of shutting down the DBMS and copying some files. That would both take the applications they support offline and possibly corrupt data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, the DBMS provides a way to export the current state of the database to disk as a *dump file*. A dump file is a (possibly very very long) list of SQL statements that recreate the database. These files can then be archived like any other file. If needed the database can be loaded (or reloaded) from a dump file. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since dump files are written in SQL, this gives the database administrator the ability to rewrite the SQL when migrating the data from one SQL dialect to another.

        "\n",
        "Importing data from files is often thought of as a database administrator function. However, analysts will find that they have to do this for themselves from time to time. \n",
        "\n",
        "The most common data text format for tabular data is CSV (comma separated values), which just about everything from Excel to Tableau, and even pandas can open with just a line or two. Unfortunately, SQL does not have native support for CSV files. Instead, each database vendor provided their own utilities, often included in a proprietary client app. None of that works in Colab, of course. \n",
        "\n",
        "Here we will consider two different ways to import CSV data from a file into a table. \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Import $\\rightarrow$ Dump $\\rightarrow$ Load**\n",
        "While we can't run desktop software in Colab, we can run it locally on our own computers and then upload to our databases in the cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "For what follows we will assume that you are using MySQL or SQLite. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1. Fire up a database client app connected to a local *mirror* copy of the database.** \n",
        "- In MySQL that means using [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) connected to a [MySQL server](https://www.mysql.com/products/standard/) running on your local computer. \n",
        "- In SQLite that means using the `sqlite3` [command line app](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) or a third-party package like [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2. Import the data.** \n",
        "- MySQL Workbench has a function just for this purpose. \n",
        "- In `sqlite3` we will need to set the mode to `csv` and then import the file. \n",
        "In both cases, a new table can be created if needed. Otherwise, data will be appended to an existing table. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3. Export the data to a dump file.**\n",
        "- MySQL has a command line utility called `mysqldump` for this. Or, we can use the export features of the MySQL Workbench app. \n",
        "- In SQLite, we can just copy the database file itself. (We did this in Lesson 1, by the way.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4. Load the dump file to somewhere Colab can find it.**\n",
        "- For MySQL, upload the file to our cloud workspace (e.g., Google Drive). Then run the dump file by either i) copying the code into a cell or ii) using pandas (see below).\n",
        "- For SQLite, all we need to do is open a database connection. It's already loaded. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Please consider the Import $\\rightarrow$ Dump $\\rightarrow$ Load technique as a last resort. There are so many ways it could go wrong. The second technique is much easier, but you will need to know a few lines of Python first.** \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Using pandas**\n",
        "The pandas package knows all about CSV files. It can also connect to SQL databases. It's all in the [pandas IO docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "The process then is exactly the same, regardless of the database vendor. The pandas package takes care of it all for us. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1. Use `pd.read_csv()` to import the data into a `DataFrame`.** You may need to read through the [`pd.read_csv()` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-read-csv-table) to get the data types and other details right. \n",

In object oriented languages things like entities and relationships are represented by software objects. These objects are defined in similar fashion to relational entities but can include functionality (methods) as well as data.

Instead they create *mappings* called *schema* that translate their software objects into equivalent SQL code. \n",
