    "2. A summary for each play in the log, generated after the game. The summaries are **analytical** data, crafted after the fact to simplify the work of the game analysts and fans. \n",

    "- `reb`: Total Rebounds\n",

    "- `2pm`: 2-point field goals made\n",
    "- `3pa`: 3-point field goals attempted\n",
    "- `3pm`: 3-point field goals made\n",
    "- `blk`: blocked shots\n",
    "- `fls`: fouls\n",
    "- `+/-`: the net score difference while the player is in the game, normalized to 36 minutes of playing time. \n",

    "The `PlayLog` table is designed to make it as simple and efficient as possible to *record* gameplay as a seuqence of events. Each row records a *play* event logged in near-real time in the course of the game. The specifics of each event (who, what, when, where, and how) are captured in numerous columns, each with a very specific meaning: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `PlayLogID` (autogenerated by the database) and `play_id` (found in the raw source data) are unique to each play and can be treated as candidate keys or *indexes*. (We'll learn more about keys and indexes in Lesson 4.)\n",
    "- `a1` - `a5` and `h1` -`h5` list which 5 players were on the court for the *away* team and the *home* team.  Each player name is unique for a given season, by the way. If there are two players with the same name -- yes, this has happened! -- then NBA stats department assigns each of the players a unique name. We'll treat the names like unique indexes for the players. \n",
    "- `event_type` indicates what kinds of statistics can be drawn from the play. A \"shot\" for example is a made shot, a \"miss\" is a missed shot, etc. \n",
    "- `player` records which player was the *subject* (initiator) of the event. If the `event_type`=\"rebound\" then the `player` is the one credited with the rebound.  \n",
    "- `opponent` is used in the event of a foul to indicate *who* on the opposing team was fouled.  \n",
    "- `possession`, `steal`, `block` work like `opponent` in that they indicate another player involved in the play. If the play is a turnover , then the player that caused the turnover would appear in one of these columns. \n",
    "- `period` (quarter), `remaining_time` (in the period), `elapsed_time` (in the period) record the approximate time of the event wihin the game. For example, `period`=1 and `remaining_time`= \"9:58\" mean the event occured in the first quarter with 9 minutes and 58 seconds on the game clock. \n",
    "- `shot_result`, `shot_distance`,\t`original_x`, `original_y`,\t`converted_x`, and\t`converted_y` are used to \"map\" the location of made and missed shots throughout a game. \n",
