It also complicates questions like \"Has Toby been married before?\" or \"Is Toby *currently married* to somebody else?\" Instead of looking up Toby (and finding licenses), we would have to scan through licenses to find any with Toby's name. A much better, more savvy, way to do it is to **register each person** separately and then **reference** them on the marriage license.

For example, MySQL Workbench can draw an ERD given any set of related tables in a MySQL database. Going the other way, from an ERD to tables, is only a little more complex. Here is a usual process, which works for just about anything except special cases like type inheritance. "
